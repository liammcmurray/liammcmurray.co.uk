<h2>Thanks for stopping by</h2>
<p>This is my little place on the web, and also where I'll (very) ocassionally <a href="https://medium.com/@liammcmurray">blog</a> about design, agile, and digital transformation.</p>
<p>I have been a web designer, content designer, user researcher, interaction designer, servicer designer. Whatever the role, I always take a user centred approach to my work.</p>
<p>Below you'll find links to the socials and networking (I'm not on many and not that active any more - but this work to contact me). Take a moment to look through my portfolio section here before you leave - it's where I list the work I'm most proud of.</p>
