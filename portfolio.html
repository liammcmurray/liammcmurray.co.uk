<h2>User research and design for new University of Bath website (2016)</h2>
<p>The university had 15.000+ pages online which had been added, updated and designed as and when needed. I counted at least 4 clearly different 'strata' of design styles for the main site, and each department had adopted their own visual ideology. I was responsible for delivering a complete, cohesive redesign of the website, and the accompanying printed undergraduate prospectus.</p>
<h3>Key responsibilities:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Replace existing brand and typography with new identity that allowed us to put content first and be more user-focused. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wgrER--Lb2eOHDZO4UZFilujuSvAqXRh48BLP03W4q4/edit?usp=sharing">Presentation</a></li>
    <li>Conduct extensive content audit. Design, test, build and iterate a series of page templates to reflected the types of content available, that met user needs, were mobile first and fully accessible.

<h2>User experience design for Defra Livestock information programme (2017)</h2>

<p>EU legislation meant that all animal movements needed to be tracked and traceable. Defra’s existing IT was not able to cope with requirements, and there was a very low uptake in using the services. I was the UX and service design specialist in a multidisciplinary team.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Lead workshops with stakeholders from the business as well as users (farmers/market sales/abattoirs) to understand the problem space.</li>

<h2>User Experience design for Defra Communities of Practice (2018)</h2>

<p>I was approached by a senior colleague to create a series of posters to increase awareness of the communities of practice within Defra for digital specialists.</p>

<h3>Key responsibilities</h3>

    <li>Working closely with a content designer to source quotes from the community describing the value of attending a community of practice.</li>

<h2>User Experience design for Defra Rod Catch Returns service (2018)</h2>

<p>Researching the existing user experience of an online service, and then proposing changes via prototyping in HTML using government templates and adhering to the government service standard (which I am currently helping to re-write). <a href="https://github.com/liammcmurray/portfolio/blob/master/RCR-as-is-blueprint.pdf">link</a></p>

<p>Leading on the prototyping of a completely new renewal service for government waste exemptions. Facilitating user research sessions, leading whiteboarding ideation workshops to look at how to provide a really simple and obvious way for business to renew their exemptions (needs to be done every 3 years, most business forget and it requires a huge amount of enforcement).</p>
