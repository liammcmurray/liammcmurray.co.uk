<h2>Context</h2>
<p>As a consultant I was brought into lead the digital transformation of this organisation to be user-centred in their approach, taking over the design direction of a failed online appeals application service. Building a small user-centred team I turned it into the first service ever to pass a government service standard assessment for the Planning Inspectorate.</p>

<h3>Key achievements</h3>

- Successfully challenged existing relationships with external suppliers that were not meeting the requirements of a service assessment.
- <a hreaf="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bTZIEjQNzVe8TbY3xzlx0GxxqUIHoh9qQKCzkspHcC8/edit?usp=sharing">Produced 10 point heuristic analysis of existing software to enable better prioritisation of new work</a>
- Instigated a design community of practice, to ensure knowledge transfer across wider organisation at it transitioned to government DDaT roles.
- Brought user-centred design to the forefront of the decision-making process
