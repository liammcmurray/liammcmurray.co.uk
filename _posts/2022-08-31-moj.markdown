<h2>Context</h2>
<p>As part of the National Probation Reform design team in HMPPS, I’ve worked across digital delivery teams and with internal stakeholders at a programme level to design joined-up user-focused microservices to replace aging legacy technical monoliths. 

Using my experience of building teams and culture, I’ve set up communities of interest around Policy, Internal Systems, and Mentoring. I’ve recently been successful in mentoring an associate designer into a middleweight role, and leading a small group (3) of early career designers within the Probation workstream.

- Lead the UCD team through the Alpha stage of a Service Assessment (we met all criteria)
- Wrote and published a <a href="https://manage-a-workforce-design-history.apps.live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/">Design History</a> - first one in MoJ!
- Used **ChatGPT** to generate a list of realistic cases for allocation
