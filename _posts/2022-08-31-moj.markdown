## Context
As part of the National Probation Reform design team in HMPPS, I worked across digital delivery teams and with internal stakeholders at a programme level to design joined-up user-focused microservices to replace aging legacy technical monoliths.

Working closely with the other members of the UCD team, I first mapped out the as-is process to identify gaps and overlaps in workflow. This also provided a great artefact to focus conversation with the business stakeholders.

From that initial research it became clear that information was scattered across many pages on many systems, and need bringing together in a clear and coherent way.

Using the **Gov Prototype Kit** in tandem with components form the MoJ's Design System, I quickly put together key screens form the propsed new user journey so that we could get user feedback on our hypotheses.

By taking a user-centred approach, I ensured the new product was meeting user needs and expectations - so much so that they wanted the new product immediately!

In addition, using my experience of building teams and culture, I set up communities of interest around Policy, Internal Systems, and Mentoring. It was my first experience of leading a small group of early career designers within the Probation workstream. SOmething I want to develop further in my next contract role.

### Key achievements
- Greatly simplified the information presented to a Probation Officer to reduce their congitive burden
- Lead the UCD team through the Alpha stage of a Service Assessment (we met all criteria)
- Wrote and published a <a href="https://manage-a-workforce-design-history.apps.live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/">Design History</a> - first one in MoJ!
- Used **ChatGPT** to generate a list of realistic cases for allocation
