<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The university had 15.000+ pages online which had been added, updated and designed as and when needed. I counted at least 4 clearly different 'strata' of design styles for the main site, and each department had adopted their own visual ideology. I was responsible for delivering a complete, cohesive redesign of the website, and the accompanying printed undergraduate prospectus.</p>
